<p>
Welcome to my first Web page in the Web Design Class.
</p>

<p>
Hello Mr. Green this is Aaron Lee.
</p>

<p>
My experience in Web Design or creating web pages is only using google sites in my digital competancy class freshman year.
I took a beginner coding course called Harvard CS50 online, but found it too difficult to complete the course without a live instructor. The course used a combination of C and C++.
</p>

<p>
My goal in this class is to be able to create my own websites or websites for business or shopping sites.
</p>

<p>
I have experience with adobe photoshop because I took Mr. Pinney's photography class last year.
</p>

<p>
I am curretly prsuing a career path in engineering. I am not sure what field of engineering I want to be in so I plan to apply to colleges as a general engineer and decide what type later.
